# 🚀 QUICK ACCESS CHECK

## Run this to check if Railway CLI works:
```bash
cd /Users/harebsaeed/Desktop/earnflow-nextjs
railway login    # If not logged in
railway status   # Check deployment
railway open     # Open site in browser!
```

## If CLI doesn't work, use the browser method:

1. **Browser**: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. **Find project** named after your GitHub repo
3. **Copy the URL** from the top
4. **Test**: Visit URL and try registration

## Your site should be live at:
`https://[project-name].up.railway.app`

## Tell me what you see when you visit Railway dashboard!
