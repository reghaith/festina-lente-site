# 🎯 EXACT COMMANDS TO ACCESS YOUR SITE

## Open Terminal and run:

```bash
# Go to your project folder
cd Desktop/earnflow-nextjs

# Login to Railway (opens browser)
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Open your live site in browser!
railway open
```

## What You'll See:
- Browser opens to Railway login
- After login, your EarnFlow site opens automatically
- URL will be: `https://something.up.railway.app`

## If That Doesn't Work:
1. Go to https://railway.app/dashboard in browser
2. Find your project
3. Click the URL at the top

## Test Your Site:
- Try registering: `test@email.com` / `password123`
- Try logging in
- Check if dashboard works

**Run `railway open` - it will open your site directly! 🚀**
